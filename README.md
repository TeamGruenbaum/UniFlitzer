# UniFlitzer

**UniFlitzer** is an innovative API designed to facilitate ride-sharing among university students. 
- User accounts: Users can provide detailed information about themselves including their age, cars, driving style and animals. Furthermore, Users can rate, favourite and block each other. Verification through university e-mail ensures a safe, student-only community.
- Create drive offers: The API allows drivers to create detailed drive offers with customizable settings. 
- Request rides: Other users can search and view drive offers and request a ride, whereby the driver decides which users he accepts as passengers. 
- Drive requests: The creation of drive requests to inspire drivers to create drive offers is also supported. 
- Drives: The participants of a drive can also see the route including all stops and the driver's current position so they can coordinate with each other.
- Carpools: Moreover, UniFlitzer promotes the formation of long-term carpools, simplifying future planning and communication.

The project is created during our Masterâ€˜s programme at Hof University of Applied Sciences.
